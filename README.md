# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview


This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset, exploring factors influencing survival and building a logistic regression model for survival prediction. 
The dataset contains information about passengers, such as age, sex, class, and ticket fare.

## Project Structure


Code: The project code is organized into an R script. The code covers data cleaning, exploration, visualization, logistic regression modeling, and dominance analysis.

Libraries Used:

pscl,
lmtest,
dominanceanalysis,
tidyverse,
psych,
gridExtra,
kableExtra,
gtsummary
